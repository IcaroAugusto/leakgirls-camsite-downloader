## Changelogs

### 2.2.2 (19/04/2020)
* Added a safeguard: if the video file size hasn't increased in the last 10 seconds it will stop streamlink. This should ensure it doesn't say 'downloading' without actually downloading anything.

### 2.2.1 (17/04/2020)
* Fixed an issue in which the program would show 'downloading' even after a stream has effectively ended

### 2.2 (16/04/2020)
* Fixed issues with stripchat
* Fixed issues with xhamsterlive
* Fixed a bug in which the program would show 'downloading' then 'idle' quickly after without downloading anything
* Fixed 'recording other models' issue with camster.com and naked.com. The issue was because camster/naked would redirect you to another model's room if the given one were offline, causing the program to record another model
* Made some changes that should increase MyFreeCams coverage

### 2.1 (15/04/2020)
* LeakGirls now uses Streamlink instead of ffmpeg, this allows it to download encrypted streams
* Fixed issues with camster.com
* Fixed issues with naked.com
* LeakGirls will now avoid 4k streams, it will download the highest resolution available up to 1080p (full hd)
* Mac version isn't updated to 2.1 yet

### 2.0 (02/04/2020)
* Added a confirmation when removing girls
* Fixed window resizing issues

* Added some quick links to the website.
* Added a version check: Every time you run the program, it will check if there is a new version.
* Updated Mac version (Mac was still on version 1.5 while others were on 1.6).

### 1.6 (05/01/2020)
* This is a big update, huge parts of the program have been rewritten.
* This aims to fix all the bugs reported so far, make it less prone to bugs and easier to fix future bugs.
* Almost everything from the javascript part has been moved to the pascal part, this let me get rid of the IPC system that was the source of almost all bugs.
* Stop download now also stops monitoring if it is active.

### 1.5
* Fixed a bug with Chaturbate streams not being downloaded.

### 1.4
* Added an option to select the video file format, you can choose between: mp4, ts and mkv.
* Fixed a few bugs related to deleting camgirls:
  * Deleting a camgirl while monitoring or downloading her, would keep downloading/monitoring in the background. Now if you delete a camgirl that is being monitored/downloaded, it will stop the operation.
  * Deleting a camgirl while one or more girls below them in the list were being downloaded or monitored would cause the status ui to display incorrectly (eg. showing "downloading" while in fact she was "idle").

### 1.3
* Monitor button will now automatically begin monitoring again after a successful download. This means you can select the models you want, hit monitor girls and leave the program running 24/7 and it will download all their future shows.
* Added support for the following websites:
  * cam
  * streamate

### 1.2
* Improved performance on slower computers
